Python code for solving the Schrodinger Equation for some
quantum physics problems.

The method used for solving the second order differential 
equation is the variational Rayleigh-Ritz method with the 
B-splines functions as a basis set.

A detailed description of the B-splines functions 
and his numerical implementation in quantum problems is in 
the paper

The code use a Scypy package for python and in particular
the bspline.py code taked from
